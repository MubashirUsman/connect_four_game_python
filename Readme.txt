Python 3.10

This is a console based implementation of connect four game.

All you have to do is to have python3 installed in your computer to play this game.

If you are in Windows: open PowerShell and change your directory to where you 
downloaded the files and type: python3 connect_four.py

If you are in Mac/Linux: open terminal and change your directory to where you 
downloaded the files and type: python3 connect_four.py

connect_four.py is the main file which contains the start_the_game function from
where the game starts.
The user is given an option to choose between another human player or a computer
player. Computer player is implemented using minimax algorithm. game_finished 
function is invoked if either player wins or game is drawn, and it asks the user 
to either restart or quit the game.

I might add GUI in future.
